# Method name: mode
# Inputs:      An arbitrary array â€” could be of anything
# Returns:     The item in the array which occurs most frequently (the mode)
# Prints:      Nothing

# If you have a list of data points, the "mode" is the data point which occurs
# most frequently. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)

# Note that the mode might not be well-defined, e.g., when two data points
# appear the same number of times.  Just return one or the other.

# As always, focus first on understanding the problem in human terms.
# If you had a long list of data points on a piece of paper, how would you
# go about finding the data point which occured most frequently?
#
# Break it down as clearly as you can in your own head first.

#COUNT # of times each number item shows up.
# (['a', 'b', 'a', 'a']) == 'a'
#For example, 'a' has 3, 'b' has 1
def item_counts(array)
  counts = Hash.new(0)

  array.each do |item|
    counts[item] = counts[item] + 1
  end
  counts
end

def mode(array) #([1,1,2,3,4])
  counts = item_counts(array) #{1=>2, 2=>1, 3=>1, 4=>1}

  array.max_by do |item|
   counts[item]
  end

  # Write some of your own "sanity checks" here.  Each check should look like:

  #  p mode([...data points...]) == ...expected return value...

  # A good sanity check is like a canary in a coal mine: when it fails we know
  # something is very wrong in our code.  This means sanity checks should
  # reflect
  #   1. The common casesmodes([1,2,3,4]) # => nil
  # p mode([1,1,2,3,4]) == 1
  # p mode([1,1,2,2,3,4]) == 1,2
  # p mode([1,1,2,2,3,4,4]) == 1,2,4
  # p mode([1,1,2,2,3,4,4], false) == 1
  # p mode([1,1,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4]) == 4

  # #   2. The edge cases
  # #   3. Likely mistakes you'll make in your code (e.g., using <= instead of <)
  # #
  # # What these cases mean concretely depends on what your method does.
  # #
  # # Here are facts about the mode that can serve as inspiration.

  # # Tip: You can generate *really* long arrays a few different ways:
  # #   1. long_array = ['a']*100
  # #   2. long_array = Array.new(100, 'a')
  # # These each generate a 100-element array consisting only of 'a'

  # # The mode of a single data point should be that data point
  # p mode([-1234.50]) == -1234.50

  # # The mode of identical data points should be that data point
  # # p mode(['hello']*100) == 'hello'

  # # The mode doesn't depend on the order of the data
  # p mode(['a', 'a', 'a', 'b']) == 'a'
  # p mode(['b', 'a', 'a', 'a']) == 'a'
  # p mode(['a', 'b', 'a', 'a']) == 'a'
end
